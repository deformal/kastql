Got it! Performance plus WebSocket-based GraphQL subscriptions — that’s a great combo to consider when picking the language and stack.

### **Performance Perspective: Go vs Rust**

- **Rust** generally offers **better raw performance and lower memory usage** thanks to zero-cost abstractions and fine-grained control over resources. For a high-throughput router handling many concurrent GraphQL subscriptions, this can mean lower latency and better efficiency under heavy load.`

- **Go** is still very performant, especially for network I/O and concurrency, thanks to goroutines and a solid runtime. It handles thousands of concurrent connections easily, but might use a bit more memory and CPU compared to Rust at extreme scale.

### **WebSocket & GraphQL Subscriptions Support**

- **Go ecosystem:**

  - There are mature libraries for WebSockets (like [gorilla/websocket](https://github.com/gorilla/websocket)) and GraphQL subscription support (e.g., gqlgen supports subscriptions).
  - Go’s concurrency model with goroutines is excellent for managing many WebSocket connections efficiently.
  - Easier to develop and maintain this support quickly, meaning faster MVP and iteration.

- **Rust ecosystem:**

  - WebSocket libraries like `tokio-tungstenite` and GraphQL crates like `async-graphql` offer solid subscription support.
  - Async Rust is very efficient but has a steeper learning curve, and development cycles might be slower.
  - You get very tight control over performance, but at the cost of complexity.

### **Summary Recommendation**

- **If you want a high-performance router _and_ faster development with good community support:**
  **Go + gqlgen + gorilla/websocket** is a solid, battle-tested combo that will perform well and be easier to maintain.

- **If you want to squeeze out the absolute max performance, and are ready for a steeper dev curve:**
  **Rust + async-graphql + tokio-tungstenite** will give you more control and efficiency but will require more effort.

### Given your goals — performance, WebSocket subscriptions, and community impact — I’d still recommend:

### **Go**

Because it’s the sweet spot between performance, development speed, ecosystem maturity, and community friendliness. Plus, it’s easier for contributors to jump in, which is important for an open-source tool.
